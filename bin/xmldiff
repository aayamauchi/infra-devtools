# information as to it's source.  Also, since this is not getting installed
# into a standard system execution path, there is no need to retain the
# original name "xmldiffs".

# There are so many "XML diff" implementations, and yet this is the *only*
# one I could find which did not flag differences in hash key ordering
# (which is *not* part of the XML standard, anyway) and did not choke
# on comments.  The original script is available at the following URL
# and is distributed under the BDS license:
#
# - https://github.com/joh/xmldiffs

# Insert converters so this might work on Mac OSuX with no further rewrites;
